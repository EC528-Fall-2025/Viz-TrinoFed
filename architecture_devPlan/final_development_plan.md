# Final Development Plan

## Sprint 1: Project Setup & Data Ingestion (9/24 - 10/1)
- Finalize system architecture and create a detailed development plan.
- Set up a local Trino environment using Docker, with PostgreSQL and MongoDB connectors configured.
- Configure and enable the Trino Kafka Event Listener to capture query events.
- Develop a basic backend service to consume events from Kafka.
- Initialize a skeleton frontend application using Reactflow and TypeScript.

**Deliverables**: Run Trino, get event listener configured, have skeleton Reactflow configurables pushed.

---

## Sprint 2: Backend Logic & MVP Visualization (10/2 - 10/15)
- Implement backend logic to parse and correlate Kafka events using query IDs.
- Develop the data model to reconstruct a hierarchical query tree from the events.
- Create a basic, non-interactive web UI to render a static query tree for a completed query.
- Connect the frontend to the backend to display the first visual results.

**Deliverables**: MVP system with a static query tree for one query.

---

## Sprint 3: Integrating Core Metrics & Error Handling (10/16 - 10/29)
- Enhance the backend to calculate timing for each query phase (planning, scheduling, execution, merging).
- Display these core performance metrics on the corresponding nodes in the UI.
- Implement logic to visually flag failed nodes in the tree.
- Show high-level error messages in the UI when a user interacts with a failed node.
- Create Grafana dashboards for advanced visualization (query latency trends, system resource usage, error rate over time).

**Deliverables**: A query tree on the webpage with metrics, error states, and expandable nodes/branches. Prometheus + Grafana dashboards with advanced metrics.

---

## Sprint 4: UI Interactivity & Refinement (10/30 - 11/12)
- Implement advanced UI features like the ability to expand and collapse nodes in the query tree.
- Add color-coded statuses for quick readability (e.g., green for success, red for error).
- Refine the overall UI/UX based on feedback to ensure the visualization is intuitive.
- Conduct end-to-end testing with complex federated queries to ensure accuracy and performance.

**Deliverables**: Interactive query tree, refined.

---

## Sprint 5: Plugin Packaging & Documentation (11/13 - 11/26)
- Structure the entire application as an installable, open-source Trino plugin.
- Create clear documentation for installation, configuration, and usage.
- Perform final system testing and address any remaining bugs.
- Prepare the project for its final presentation and public release.

**Deliverables**: Open-source plugin repo, documentation, demo-ready system.
