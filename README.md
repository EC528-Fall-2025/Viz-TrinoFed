## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

### Goal
This project aims to enhance the observability of Trino as a federated query engine by providing clear visibility into the full lifecycle of a queryâ€™s execution. While Trino allows users to query across differing data sources as if they were a single system, the lack of transparency into how queries are parsed, scheduled, and executed poses challenges for performance monitoring and troubleshooting. The current UI is complex and technical, representing a significant barrier to user understanding. By developing a visualization of query trees with extensive time-spent metrics, this project will enable users to better understand query behavior, identify performance bottlenecks, and correct errors, ultimately improving user and developer productivity with Trino. 

### Features
- Clear Phases: Separate visualizations for each phase of querying (planning, scheduling, execution, merging).
- Query tree visualization: A visual representation of Trino query plans and their decomposition into sub-queries and tasks.
- Integration of Metrics: A display of execution metrics such as planning time, scheduling delays, execution time per connector, network latency, and join/merge performance.
- Error Mapping: A list of surface errors and exceptions in the visualization, showing exactly where failures occurred within the query tree, displayed at a high-level, and optionally in low-level detail. 
- Performance Analysis: Identification of bottlenecks across the federated data sources, allowing performance tuning by making visible the impact of connector behavior, delays, and scheduling overhead.
- Intuitive UI: Interactive visualization interface using React and Typescript. 
- Trino Plugin Integration: Develop this as an open-source Trino plugin to make usage easy for widespread implementation on Trino. 


## 2. Users / Personas of the Project

This project is designed for people who work with distributed data systems and need deep visibility into how queries traverse multiple data sources. By visualizing Trino query trees and exposing timing and error data for each stage (planning, scheduling, execution, network latency, connector-level work), this tool helps users diagnose issues, optimize performance, and build more reliable systems.

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:
### 1. User-Friendly Visualization of Trino Query Trees
- Develop an interactive web UI that allows users to explore how queries are executed in Trino.  
- Replace Trinoâ€™s verbose `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output with a simplified, user-friendly tree view.  
- Highlight the execution flow across multiple connectors (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) in a way that is accessible to non-expert users.  

---

### 2. Query Execution Tree Display
- Show how a user query is decomposed into subqueries and pushed down to different connectors.  
- Visualize the hierarchy of operations clearly: **Planning â†’ Scheduling â†’ Execution â†’ Merging**.  
- Represent dependencies and data flow between subqueries using an intuitive diagram.  

---

### 3. Performance Metrics Collection and Visualization
- Collect query metrics using Trinoâ€™s **observability features** (OpenTelemetry, OpenMetrics).  
- Leverage the **Kafka Event Listener** ([Trino Kafka Listener Docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/event-listeners-kafka.html)) to capture query events.  
- Correlate events using **query IDs** to build accurate execution trees.  
- Display execution times for each phase (planning, scheduling, execution, network, merging).  
- Provide both **aggregated total query time** and **per-phase breakdowns** so users can see where time is spent (Trino vs. underlying DB).  

---

### 4. Error and Failure Representation
- Capture query execution errors and display them in the execution tree at the exact phase where they occur.  
- Highlight error types (timeouts, connector failures, parsing errors) with clear, color-coded indicators.  
- Provide a **high-level error summary** with an option to drill down into detailed error logs.  

---

### 5. Interactive User Interface Features
- Implement the frontend with **ReactFlow and TypeScript** to enable interactive visualization.  
- Expand/collapse nodes for exploring subquery details.  
- Hover or click nodes to view connector metadata, execution time, and error messages.  
- Use **color-coded statuses** for quick readability:  
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = success  
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = slow or high latency  
  - ðŸ”´ Red = error  

---

### 6. System Integration
- Use the official **Trino Docker image** ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/trinodb/trino)) for local development and testing.  
- Configure at least **two connectors** (PostgreSQL and MongoDB) as catalogs ([PostgreSQL Connector Docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/postgresql.html)).  
- Run federated queries that join across PostgreSQL and MongoDB to test visualization accuracy.  
- Feed captured metrics and events from Kafka into the visualization UI.  

---

### 7. Security and Reliability Considerations
- Ensure that only **query metadata and metrics** are visualized, never sensitive query results.  
- Build fault tolerance into the metrics collection process so that it does not interfere with Trinoâ€™s execution.  

---

### 8. Scalability and Extensibility
- Support larger federated queries involving multiple subqueries across different connectors.  
- Extendable design for future connectors beyond PostgreSQL and MongoDB.  
- Provide a foundation for optional integration with external observability platforms such as Prometheus or Grafana.  

---

## Out of Scope
- Modifying Trinoâ€™s internal query engine or scheduling mechanisms.  
- Full-scale production integration with observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).  
- Predictive query optimization or automatic performance tuning.  
- Supporting all connectors (initial scope limited to PostgreSQL and MongoDB).

## 4. Solution Concept

## Introduction
To complement the processing of queries on Trino, a distributed SQL query engine written in Java, our project aims to make the user end even more friendly and reveal more information than already shown about the lifecycle of each query. We want to reveal the complete life cycle of a query across all federated data sources. Taking the already shown runtime metrics and query plan structures from Trino, we will enrich them with more information like error data or connector-level performance, then display them in an interactive display tree, whether in a plugin, separate hosted website, or in any way most visually pleasing and precise. Thus, our project can give developers and engineers an intuitive view at query execution, failures and bookmarks. 

## Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:
### 1. Data Collection Layer
- Retrieve query plans and details in JSON format. This is done with Trinoâ€™s EXPLAIN (TYPE DISTRIBUTED, FORMAT JSON) SQL command or with coordinator endpoints.
- Capture runtime metrics through Trinoâ€™s API and own built in metrics, EXPLAIN ANALYZE output, or directly from any workers on the system. Some metrics we will capture include execution time, errors, execution time and I/O information.  
- Use a broker such as Kafka to capture execution events and push them downstream to our visualization services and display them.

### 2. Processing and Aggregation Layer
- **Metrics Aggregator**: Normalize raw events like planning, execution, scheduling, join stages and merge stages into a common schema.
- **Error Mapping**: Associate from connectors (like PostgreSQL errors) with the corresponding nodes in the query tree.
- **Time Allocation**: Calculate the time spent in each stage with scheduling, connector execution, and network transfer metrics.
- **Observability Integration**: Export enhanced metrics from our project to either Prometheus or Grafana for time monitoring alongside visualization.

### 3. Visualization Layer
- **Render the tree**: The distributed query tree should be a visible, interactive, step by step and easy to follow tree. We will use React frontend with visualizer tools.
- **Each node should reveal**:
  - Operator/sub-query type (scan, join, aggregate etc.)
  - Source system (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
  - Execution metrics (rows processed, latency, cost)
  - Errors or warnings
- **Timeline**: Create a timeline on the sidebar to show the order of planning, scheduling, execution and merging to complement the tree structure.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to scroll through the tree, walk through execution flow, collapse or expand subtrees and nodes to focus on bottlenecks and walk through individual metrics. 

### 4. Deployment Model
- **Backend**:  A lightweight service, likely written in Java, the same language as Trino, or Node.js to integrate with React better. This backend connects to Trino and handles the plans, metrics, and then exposes them via GraphQL API to the frontend
- **Scalability**: Deploy on Kubernetes with Kafka for event streaming. Use Prometheus/Grafana for observability. 
- Modular components for others to integrate with existing Trino monitoring tools.

 
## Design Implications and Discussion:

### 1. Design Implications
- **Transparency**: Makes federated query execution across multiple different data sources transparent to the convenience of engineers and programmers who need to identify bottlenecks, learn the database queries quickly, and improves presentation for software products.
- **Debugging**: Find slow queries, connector-level failures, and failed query connections.
- **Educational**: Help new users understand distributed query execution, not only new programmers but also new hires in an office to see their database easier and get started faster.
- **Extendible**: Built on open tools like Prometheus or Kafka that can then scale and integrate into existing systems.
- **Not just UI**: A pipeline of observability for distributed query execution, in depth at every step. 
- **Observability**: Doesnâ€™t interfere with Trino events, only observing events.

### 2. Design Choices:
- **Kafka**: Kafka is a good broker because Trino generates query events asynchronously, so Kafka provides durability, scalability, and replayability. Kafka also decouples event capture from visualization.
- **JSON Queries and API Integration**: Trino has existing JSON outputs (EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, REST endpoints), so we will use these existing outputs to make this product compatible with all Trino core engines, lightweight, and future proof against future Trino updates.
- **Reactflow**: The best choice for readable frontend of the tree rather than a static log output. We will have expand/collapse nodes, color-coded statuses, and hover interactions to make the simple metrics of the default Trino more readable.
- **Security choices**: Only expose query metadata and execution metrics, never query results. This way, no sensitive data is leaked. 

## 5. Acceptance criteria

This section discusses the minimum acceptance criteria at the end of the project and stretch goals.

## 6.  Release Planning:

Release planning section describes how the project will deliver incremental sets of features and functions in a series of releases to completion. Identification of user stories associated with iterations that will ease/guide sprint planning sessions is encouraged. Higher level details for the first iteration is expected.

## General comments

Remember that you can always add features at the end of the semester, but you can't go back in time and gain back time you spent on features that you couldn't complete.
