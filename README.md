## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

### Goal
This project aims to enhance the observability of Trino as a federated query engine by providing clear visibility into the full lifecycle of a queryâ€™s execution. While Trino allows users to query across differing data sources as if they were a single system, the lack of transparency into how queries are parsed, scheduled, and executed poses challenges for performance monitoring and troubleshooting. The current UI is complex and technical, representing a significant barrier to user understanding. By developing a visualization of query trees with extensive time-spent metrics, this project will enable users to better understand query behavior, identify performance bottlenecks, and correct errors, ultimately improving user and developer productivity with Trino. 

### Features
- Clear Phases: Separate visualizations for each phase of querying (planning, scheduling, execution, merging).
- Query tree visualization: A visual representation of Trino query plans and their decomposition into sub-queries and tasks.
- Integration of Metrics: A display of execution metrics such as planning time, scheduling delays, execution time per connector, network latency, and join/merge performance.
- Error Mapping: A list of surface errors and exceptions in the visualization, showing exactly where failures occurred within the query tree, displayed at a high-level, and optionally in low-level detail. 
- Performance Analysis: Identification of bottlenecks across the federated data sources, allowing performance tuning by making visible the impact of connector behavior, delays, and scheduling overhead.
- Intuitive UI: Interactive visualization interface using React and Typescript. 
- Trino Plugin Integration: Develop this as an open-source Trino plugin to make usage easy for widespread implementation on Trino. 


## 2. Users / Personas of the Project

This project is designed for people who work with distributed data systems and need deep visibility into how queries traverse multiple data sources. By visualizing Trino query trees and exposing timing and error data for each stage (planning, scheduling, execution, network latency, connector-level work), this tool helps users diagnose issues, optimize performance, and build more reliable systems.

**In short:**  
Anyone who needs to understand, debug, and optimize queries that span multiple data sources in Trino will benefit from this toolâ€™s ability to make the entire query lifetime visible and comprehensible.

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:
### 1. User-Friendly Visualization of Trino Query Trees
- Develop an interactive web UI that allows users to explore how queries are executed in Trino.  
- Replace Trinoâ€™s verbose `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output with a simplified, user-friendly tree view.  
- Highlight the execution flow across multiple connectors (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) in a way that is accessible to non-expert users.  

---

### 2. Query Execution Tree Display
- Show how a user query is decomposed into subqueries and pushed down to different connectors.  
- Visualize the hierarchy of operations clearly: **Planning â†’ Scheduling â†’ Execution â†’ Merging**.  
- Represent dependencies and data flow between subqueries using an intuitive diagram.  

---

### 3. Performance Metrics Collection and Visualization
- Collect query metrics using Trinoâ€™s **observability features** (OpenTelemetry, OpenMetrics).  
- Leverage the **Kafka Event Listener** ([Trino Kafka Listener Docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/event-listeners-kafka.html)) to capture query events.  
- Correlate events using **query IDs** to build accurate execution trees.  
- Display execution times for each phase (planning, scheduling, execution, network, merging).  
- Provide both **aggregated total query time** and **per-phase breakdowns** so users can see where time is spent (Trino vs. underlying DB).  

---

### 4. Error and Failure Representation
- Capture query execution errors and display them in the execution tree at the exact phase where they occur.  
- Highlight error types (timeouts, connector failures, parsing errors) with clear, color-coded indicators.  
- Provide a **high-level error summary** with an option to drill down into detailed error logs.  

---

### 5. Interactive User Interface Features
- Implement the frontend with **ReactFlow and TypeScript** to enable interactive visualization.  
- Expand/collapse nodes for exploring subquery details.  
- Hover or click nodes to view connector metadata, execution time, and error messages.  
- Use **color-coded statuses** for quick readability:  
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = success  
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = slow or high latency  
  - ðŸ”´ Red = error  

---

### 6. System Integration
- Use the official **Trino Docker image** ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/trinodb/trino)) for local development and testing.  
- Configure at least **two connectors** (PostgreSQL and MongoDB) as catalogs ([PostgreSQL Connector Docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/postgresql.html)).  
- Run federated queries that join across PostgreSQL and MongoDB to test visualization accuracy.  
- Feed captured metrics and events from Kafka into the visualization UI.  

---

### 7. Security and Reliability Considerations
- Ensure that only **query metadata and metrics** are visualized, never sensitive query results.  
- Build fault tolerance into the metrics collection process so that it does not interfere with Trinoâ€™s execution.  

---

### 8. Scalability and Extensibility
- Support larger federated queries involving multiple subqueries across different connectors.  
- Extendable design for future connectors beyond PostgreSQL and MongoDB.  
- Provide a foundation for optional integration with external observability platforms such as Prometheus or Grafana.  

---

## Out of Scope
- Modifying Trinoâ€™s internal query engine or scheduling mechanisms.  
- Full-scale production integration with observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).  
- Predictive query optimization or automatic performance tuning.  
- Supporting all connectors (initial scope limited to PostgreSQL and MongoDB).
